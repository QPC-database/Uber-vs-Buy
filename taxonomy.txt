-segment: car, suv, pickup, minivan
-size: subcompact, compact, midsized, large
-premium: true false
TODO:
-servicing

Drill down abilities: Bar chart values (sales in 2017 or mpg/empg)
Top - all cars by year
Second - break by segment or by size
Third - filter for premium or not

Step 1: Visualize the car market
-script to break name into brand and model (split and set brand as index 0 then make 1-n the model)
-script to add in the servicing attribute to the dataset based on price (function should have an increase if a premium car like 1.3x)
-Bar chart
-Marimekko Chart 
-waterfall chart (to show the differences between sales over time in cars)
-line chart
-slope graphs to compare trends between two years
-Coxcomb/pie chart
-treemap
-circle packing

Step 2: Make a car decision
-dendrogram that goes down
-once item selected store in memory and go to step 3

Step 3: Uber comparison
-prompt the user with information
-show the user differences in ubers, select UberX per se
-make calculations and recommendation

Step 4: Comparison
-allow user to drag for the # of miles per year up and down accordingly
