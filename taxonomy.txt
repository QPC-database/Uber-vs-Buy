-electric: true or false --> if true there will be an "empg" attribute which is the battery range
-segment: car, suv, pickup, minivan
-size: subcompact, compact, midsized, large
-premium: true false
TODO:
-servicing
-brand & model (versus just name)
-price

Pre-work:
-enter price on each car
-script to break name into brand and model (split and set brand as index 0 then make 1-n the model)
-script to add in the servicing attribute to the dataset based on price (function should have an increase if a premium car like 1.3x)

Drill down abilities: Bar chart values (sales in 2017 or mpg/empg or price)
Top - all cars by year
Second - break by segment or by size
Third - filter for premium or not

*Have a part of the page that says what step you are on and what the step is for*

Step 1: Visualize the car market
HIGH
-Bar chart (column click drill down)
-line chart (line click drill down)
MED
-treemap (sub square drill down)
LOW
-Coxcomb/pie chart (slice click drill down)

Step 2: Make a car decision
INITIALLY: just a set of questions (later if time: dendrogram that goes down) 
once car selected: ask amount of years expecting to keep the car
HIGH:
-waterfall & line (static)
-number for mpg/empg
-premium or electric showing so if so
-once item selected store in memory and go to step 3

Step 3: Uber comparison 
-prompt the user with information
-show the user differences in ubers, select UberX per se

[make calculations and recommendation]

Step 4: Comparison [similar to NY times article]
-allow user to drag for the # of miles per year up and down accordingly
-expect the car longer or shorter

Tasks:
David - pre work, help step 1 visualizations, and step 4
Anmol - framwork, step 2 cards, step 3
Dubem - take lead on step 1 visualizations
