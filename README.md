# INF 554 Assignment for 5

Update this README as needed.

1. Lead with 10 words on why you chose this project 

Buy a car versus Uber is the new Rent versus Buy

2. Why is your project interesting?

The car market has been going through a fundamental shift with the disruption of shared economy services like Uber and Lyft as well as with EVs. This project will do two things. One, explore the changes in car sales due to this (filters by brand, car type, gas mileage, and expected yearly cost). Two, based on your average daily commute and car you expect to buy, it will do a comparison to help you decide whether it would be better for you to uber instead of owning a car. 

3. Who is the audience for your project?

Our project has two audiences. One, those who are debating whether to buy a car but are unsure about what kind of car to buy, or if to buy anyone at all considering Uber/Lyft. Two, those just generally interested in the automobile market trends. 

4. Why is your visualization important?

It allows users to drill down to a deep level in exploring the automobile market. Moreover, it helps the user decide whether to buy a car or Uber/Lyft.

5. How is your visualization useful?

It has broad implications for both exploratory and serious users. 

6. What are you telling with your visualization? What is the story?

The story is to first explore the automobile market in general. What kind of cars are selling at a faster pace? (i.e. EV cars, high mileage cars, etc.) It then bases your daily commute to see if buying the car of choice is better than ubering to your destination and a rough estimate of the savings either way.

7. How do you plan to use interactive visuals?

Drill down functionality for the car market in general. After a selection it will move you to a different screen to enter your local information to compute the uber prices that you can expect. 

8. What are your design considerations?

We need to be especially conscious of how we break up our information. We have two separate data components: the automobile market information and the uber ride data. We want to make sure they don't cause the user to be confused in the interface. We would like them to be able to use the app intuitively. 

9. What are the components that make your visualization cool?

The drill down abilties and the added functionality to compare to uber prices makes the visualization cool. 

10. How does your visualization compare to what others have done?

11. What are the technologies you plan to use?

D3, Uber API, JavaScript

12. How are you going to design, build, and evaluate?



13. What are your deliverables?

Merge databases and integrate fields
Data preprocessing
Visualize general trends for the car industry with drill-down
Develop uber comparison functionality
Add visualizations around the buy vs. uber decision

14. How do you work together?

We will meet every week on Mondays. We will go for at least a 4 hour time period and break up work for the remaining week.

15. What is your timeline?
